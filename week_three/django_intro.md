#### Intro To Django

## Objectives:
    - Introduce request/response
    - Build our first web application

## Request/Response
    - what is a request?
    - who makes a request?
    - what responds?
    - what is a response?
    - how does this tie into Django/Python?

## Our First Web App
    - create a django project
    - root route renders "Hello World!" HttpResponse
    - url '/goodbye' renders "Goodbye World!" HttpResponse
    - url '/<name>' renders "Hello <name>" HttpResponse

    - alter previous routes to render HTML content in a header tag
    - add static styles
