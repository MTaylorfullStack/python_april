#### Our Task

-   The Great Number Game!




#### Great Number Game

- build an application that allows the user to input a number between 0 and 10 and username into a form

- upon form submission, a random number between 0 and 10 should be generated

- compare the user submitted number with the randomly generated number

- user should be notified if their number was too high, too low, or spot on

- STRETCH GOAL - provide a feed of previous user's submissions

- STRETCH GOAL - low guesses in feed should be red, high guesses blue, and perfect guesses green
